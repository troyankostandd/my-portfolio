      "Built a customer-facing analytics SaaS used by about 18k monthly users, developing the frontend with React and Next.js and adding server-side rendering to fix SEO and slow initial page loads.",
      "Migrated a legacy PHP reporting backend to NestJS with TypeScript and PostgreSQL, fixing long-running queries and adding indexes after peak-hour requests exceeded acceptable response times.",
      "Created internal admin tools using Vue.js so operations teams could manage data without relying on manual spreadsheet updates.",
      "Designed and maintained REST and GraphQL APIs for web and mobile clients, handling breaking changes, partial rollouts, and backward compatibility for older versions.",
      "Added Redis caching and background processing with RabbitMQ to handle traffic spikes during billing periods and reduce synchronous request failures.",
      "Deployed services on AWS (EC2, RDS, S3) and later containerized them with Docker and Kubernetes, resolving autoscaling and health-check issues in production.",
      "Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins, replacing manual deployments and reducing rollback time to under ten minutes.",
      "Built a nightly data sync service with FastAPI (Python), storing results in PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch so teams could run reports without impacting production traffic.",
      "Optimized PostgreSQL and MySQL performance using connection pooling, read replicas, and query tuning after load tests showed high p95 latency.",
      "Applied DDD and Clean Architecture when splitting a growing monolith into smaller services, which made the system easier to maintain and onboard new developers.",

      "Spent time improving database performance, mostly in PostgreSQL, after slow queries started showing up under real production traffic.",
      "Integrated third-party services such as payment and shipping providers, dealing with messy edge cases around data formats and authentication.",
      "Added Redis caching for sessions and frequently accessed product data when traffic spikes began to affect response times.",
      "Set up and maintained CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, replacing manual deployments and making releases easier to repeat and roll back.",
