Company Name: Netguru
Duration: 11/2021 – 12/2025
Location: Warsaw, Poland
Type: Remote
Experience: 
-	Built a customer-facing analytics SaaS used by about 18k monthly users, developing the frontend with React and Next.js and adding server-side rendering to fix SEO and slow initial page loads.
-	Migrated a legacy PHP reporting backend to NestJS with TypeScript and PostgreSQL, fixing long-running queries and adding indexes after peak-hour requests exceeded acceptable response times.
-	Created internal admin tools using Vue.js so operations teams could manage data without relying on manual spreadsheet updates.
-	Designed and maintained REST and GraphQL APIs for web and mobile clients, handling breaking changes, partial rollouts, and backward compatibility for older versions.
-	Added Redis caching and background processing with RabbitMQ to handle traffic spikes during billing periods and reduce synchronous request failures.
-	Deployed services on AWS (EC2, RDS, S3) and later containerized them with Docker and Kubernetes, resolving autoscaling and health-check issues in production.
-	Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins, replacing manual deployments and reducing rollback time to under ten minutes.
-	Built a nightly data sync service with FastAPI (Python), storing results in PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch so teams could run reports without impacting production traffic.
-	Optimized PostgreSQL and MySQL performance using connection pooling, read replicas, and query tuning after load tests showed high p95 latency.
-	Applied DDD and Clean Architecture when splitting a growing monolith into smaller services, which made the system easier to maintain and onboard new developers.
