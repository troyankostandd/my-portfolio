Hi, How are you doing?

I'm a code mania who have been writing codes as a professional developer for
12 years.

I spend more than 12 hours per day by writing codes.

My first programming language was C++, and now the strongest programming language is Javascript and Python.

I'm interested in blockchain, AI, machine learning technologies, and like tricks on frontend visual effects.
